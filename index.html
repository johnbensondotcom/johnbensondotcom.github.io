        <a href="/software/2018/05/29/Software-Updates-Everywhere.html">Software Updates Everywhere</a>
      </h2>

      <p>It would seem that all of the iOS developers have finished up their big projects prior to their worlds being upended by new stuff to be announced at WWDC next week..</p>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/05/ios-11-4-brings-stereo-pairs-and-multi-room-audio-with-airplay-2/">iOS 11.4</a> will be out by the time you’re reading this, adding AirPlay 2 and Messages in iCloud. Both of these must have been much harder to implement than was thought when they were announced at WWDC last year. Messages in iCloud is fairly exciting if you’re a message-deleter. Delete the message from one device and it should be deleted from all of them. Much like Photos in iCloud, this should make it easier for folks to get smaller iPhones as long as they pay a little for extra iCloud storage.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ulyssesapp.com/releases/">Ulysses</a> is out with a regular update that makes some improvements to code block handling, as well as some other features that I don’t interact with all that much. Hopefully Markdown Table support’s on the horizon too. I switched to using Ulysses a few months ago after a year noodling around with Bear. It’s good for prose, but certainly isn’t a code editor, but that’s just fine.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.1password.com/explore/whats-new-mac/">1Password</a> is out with a new version, that I hope fixes the lagging performance from the browser plugin I’ve been waiting through for the past six months ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/blog/omnifocus-3-for-ios-available-for-pre-order">OmniFocus 3</a> for iOS is due out in the next day. I’ve been using the betas and I’m pretty excited about some of the changes that Omni’s made to make the tool a little more flexible. It’s being released as an iOS App first, which is a real bummer as someone that uses the desktop version much more than either iPhone or iPad versions. <a href="http://www.usingomnifocus.com/2018/05/impressions-of-omnifocus-3-releasing-may-30-on-ios/">Kourosh Dini</a> has a nice overview of what’s new.</p>

<p><a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/whats-new/">Things</a> also pushed out an update that brings keyboard shortcuts to their iOS version. I played around with Things back in the fall and really liked it. It didn’t have a lot of the power features that OmniFocus did, but re-ordering stuff and planning out the day in the morning was really nice. I was about to switch when the OmniFocus 3 beta program opened up so I’m excited to try both of them. Competition is a good thing.</p>

<p><a href="http://getdrafts.com">Drafts 5</a> was released a few weeks ago, and while it remains one of the more fiddly time sucking programs I’ve used, it’s a very neat update.</p>

      </h2>

      <p>Apple has made a change to how encrypted iOS backups are handled in iOS 11 that makes it easier to deal with a forgotten backup password, but creates a cascading effect that makes your phone passcode the only thing standing between an attacker and access to all of the credentials iOS keychain.</p>

      </h2>

      <p>It’s been a little while since there had been any changes to the website so I took a little time this week to spruce things up a little bit. Before I make a flurry of posts to push the old stuff off the first page here are a few excerpts from the change log…</p>

<p>*All of the old content from bitninja.org has been migrated and (in theory) should remain accessible via the old URLs as well as the new. That stuff is really old, but I keep it there because at least until I fell asleep at the DNS server people were still regularly accessing the content. I know I hate it when I run into linkrot and want to do my part to keep links, bookmarks, and citations working.</p>

<p>*I’ve created a collection of documentation and other short articles which talk about some commonly conducted forensics and electronic discovery tasks. It’s the kind of thing that I give out at CLEs and it doesn’t really make much sense to just dump into a blog post. I really hope to revisit these pages from time to time to keep them current. If you see something that is no longer accurate, or has simply become woefully outdated, drop me a line.</p>

<p>*I put together a categorized list of talks that I’ve given over the past few years. This was taken from the old website and is not current.</p>

<p>*If you happened to be one of the probably no people that had subscribed to the RSS feed, you may want to update your feed to reflect the john-benson.com domain instead. The old one should continue to work just fine for now, but I don’t plan on working around that in the future.</p>

<p>*For those of you who use Twitter, you can also follow me @john_benson which will have links to any new posts that I make</p>

<p>*Comments are on. I guess we’ll see how that works out, right?</p>

      </h2>

      <p>This fall a new file system is coming to Apple computers. It’s already been deployed to iOS with little impact on the digital forensics community, but APFS on the desktop is fairly big news.</p>

<p>If you’re someone who uses a Mac to analyze Macs, then getting support is easy. Upgrade your machine to High Sierra. If you use tools on Windows to analyze Macs I’m not sure what you’ll be looking at in terms of support.</p>
