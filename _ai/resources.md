# Toolkit

## Web Based AI Platforms

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/?oai-dm=1) - Be sure to disable model improvement 
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/chats) - No model improvement by default
- [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) - Be sure to disable model improvement
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) - Gemini takes your prompts and outputs unless you pay extra

## Software

- [Raycast](https://raycast.com) - This application launcher has perhaps the most flexible and reliable to work with language models. It's also the most secure option. This is one anyone can figure out. 
- [Msty](https://msty.app/) - The simplest way to run models locally on a computer. Cross platform and can connect to any of the frontier models if you have API keys
- [Arc](https://arc.net/gift/fde61811) - Arc is the browser I use on my phone and on my computer. It takes some getting used to but I'll never go back to anything else

## Background on AI

- [Microsoft Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pbPLHYB6-0) - Wonderful presentation that breaks down generative AI into something that's not so threatening.
- [Generative AI exists because of the transformer](https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/) - Excellent written piece that summarizes how generative text ai works at a low level that anyone can understand.
- [Co-Intelligence](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNFCRJ77?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_HAJD44100A2GZ6HXTF6G&skipTwisterOG=2) - Probably the best resource on understanding the current potential of generative AI as a working partner
- [Sources of Harm in Machine Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3465416.3483305) - Before engaging in any kind of project where you are fully delegating to a machine this should be part of your foundational understanding.
- [The Great Mental Models](https://fs.blog/books/mental-models-vol1/) - As you move past discovering that models know how to talk, and you can give them things to think about, the next stage is teaching them how to think about your problem.
- [Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/the-ethics-of-advanced-ai-assistants/) - This paper is a monster, but a comprehensive look at the ethics of AI as language models start to be able to perform tasks with less human supervision.
- [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762) -  - The paper that ignited the current wave of innovation
