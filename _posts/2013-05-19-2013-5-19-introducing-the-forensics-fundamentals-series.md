I'm happy to announce a new series of posts which will cover some of the fundamentals of digital forensics. The audience for these posts won't necessarily be my peers in the digital forensics community, but my peers within the legal profession. Hopefully it will be a good resource for attorneys who are wanting to use digital forensics more in their practice or forensic investigators who want to bring their clients up to speed with some of the basic vocabulary of the field.


The seasoned forensic investigators will likely notice that I may gloss over some of the more nuanced points, but keep in mind when reviewing these that the articles are tailored to those who want to get a grasp of the fundamentals first without getting lost in a dizzying discussion of technical details.


If there are any topics that you'd like me to cover, feel free to drop me a line.
