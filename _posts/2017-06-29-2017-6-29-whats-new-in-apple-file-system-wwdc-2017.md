This fall a new file system is coming to Apple computers. It's already been deployed to iOS with little impact on the digital forensics community, but APFS on the desktop is fairly big news.

If you're someone who uses a Mac to analyze Macs, then getting support is easy. Upgrade your machine to High Sierra. If you use tools on Windows to analyze Macs I'm not sure what you'll be looking at in terms of support.
