I always keep the Apple wireless keyboard in the Origami in my backpack since I got it a few years ago. It's great to be able to use the same keyboard at home, on my desk at the office or anywhere I travel. Making sure the keyboard stays powered off in my bag is harder than you'd think and the velcro is pretty worn out, but when it goes I'll replace it with another one just like it.
