It sure sounds like there's a lot to come in the new version of iOS. The visual design is as polarizing as was rumored and I certainly have some mixed feelings about but there's one app that really stands out as being incredible. The compass. There may be some rough edges in some other apps, but I'm pretty sure this one has achieved perfection.
